Well, it's time.

I'm back. Hello, world!

jens-hausdorf.de is no longer … uhm … dead (or redirecting to my LinkedIn profile).
So, what kind of content can you expect from it?
Well, I don't know yet.
Something I have ever struggled with is to provide meaningful and regular content -- so let's see where this is going.

I want to work on that though and start blogging as a way to get my thoughts in order and because I want to give back.
I'm really thankful for everything I could learn from the free and open web (kudos to Mozilla for fighting for it).
As you can see during this blog post, especially at the beginning, I haven't had someone mentoring me.
I really learned a lot by trial and error as well as through learning materials from the Internet.
As a kind of safe heaven, it has also helped me to navigate through the rough times my younger self was facing -- ultimately shaping my character.

So to start with the first piece of content, let's rewind what happened in the last few years and changed since then.
Also, we'll take a look into what's going to happen in the future.
For as far as I can say, at least.

This blog post is mainly targeted to remind myself of what I did and what I have experienced during the times.
If you think this is interesting for you as well, let me know on [Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@jens1o)!

## Initial traces dating back to 2013

To remind myself of what I did, I started with doing research on me.

The Internet Wayback Machine holds [records from my (then German) website](https://web.archive.org/web/20141217154705/http://jens-hausdorf.de/) from late 2014 on.
As you can see in the Copyright notice there, I have had a website since 2013.

At (only) 10 to 11 years of age -- I can't remember exactly whether I started with my personal website before or after my 11th birthday.
(For reference, I'm 20 years old at the time of writing.)
Wow!

To be fair, its content was not as important to me as having a website itself.
It was mainly a sandbox, so I could learn a lot from it.
What kind of elements does a website have?
Where could I use what kind of element?
How do I structure my stuff to provide (some kind of) value to my - not so big amount of - visitors?
(Mainly, it was myself who used it…)

It was using a proprietary content management system my dad was using as a foundation to his online shop he had back then.
It was called "shop to date" (by DATA BECKER) - a piece of software that doesn't exist anymore.
Driven by its quite terrible User Experience back in the day, it really felt like exploring, and (so) I spent hours in the tool.

The elements I arranged resulted in a collection of things I found on the Internet back then.
Like Easter eggs, interesting doodles from Google front pages etc.

As you can see in the Wayback Machine, I have also experimented with coding.
I have written a web browser in Visual Basic. I still know how bad the coding was. I still remember how I copied a bunch of if-else statements because I wasn't aware of arrays and loops.
Yet it worked - and I have received a few e-mails from folks that were using it!

The first e-mail, the first feedback from users in the guest book I had then.
Wow.
It felt like… I don't know --- incredible.
Now I think that maybe my parents wrote some comments, but if I remember correctly, I stared at the IP addresses - and they were different to what we had back then.
(So maybe they *were* really existing humans that found my website on their own?)

However, it was prior to 2013 where I started to get creative with computers.

## Prior to 2013

During kindergarten, I was allowed to play some games from the "Toggolino Club" on a Windows XP laptop.
There you could play games on the website while learning some (really fundamental) stuff.
If I remember correctly, it cost about five euros per month.

I still remember how I played and sang along the alphabet song to my younger sister to teach her the alphabet.
She sometimes sat in front of the laptop together with me.

The Toggolino Club was my admission to use a computer -- most of the time, unsupervised.
Once more, from time to time it was more interesting to learn about what the underlying system itself allowed me to do, and essentially how it worked.
(Like how to start other programs like the Windows Explorer or the preferences of Windows and what they do.)

But its access was regulated.
I had time schedules, and I wasn't allowed to use the laptop any longer than what was ruled to me.

This was because I wasn't the only one using it - and also, to not get "rechteckige Augen" (rectangular eyes) as my mum used to say.
From time to time, my dad was updating the online shop my mum had back then.
It wasn't using any content management system and its layout was composed of HTML tables, and gifs, and a lot of other images.
And HTML forms that were redirecting to PayPal.
I can't remember of any CSS I have seen then.
But I remember how I was - sometimes - allowed to sit next to my dad and sometimes type some keystrokes to write some text.

Seeing the result of what I typed -- in the web browser I only knew from learning games…
That must have felt great!

And while HTML is not any programming language, this was how I got creative with computers and that continued through primary school.

## My very first own PC

We then moved to another city during my last year of kindergarten.

If I remember correctly, at the age of five, I've been given my own PC.
It was running Windows Vista and it was great!

I had unregulated access (hehe).

I played a lot of computer games back then, like Driving Simulator (Fahr-Simulator 2009) by Astragon or Train Simulator.
I had a lot of interest in trains -- I was even allowed to drive and control a *real physical train* by sitting on the lap of a train driver during a school event.
During 3rd or 4th grade, I had given a presentation about the city of Karlsruhe, and I used it as an opportunity to talk about the Karlsruhe Tram-Train model and put the focus on it.
(I mean, it's world-famous!)
Back then, I wouldn't imagine I'd pursue a career in IT, but instead to I wanted to become a train driver.

Honestly, I have repressed a lot from that time and I have only so limited memories left.
During primary school, the bullying began.
Physical education classes were especially awful for me because we went to the gym by bus - without any teacher in sight.
We only saw our teacher after changing clothes when we were picked up by the stairs - a lot of time.
In general, I hated breaks and wished that the lessons were going on forever.

However, there is a major milestone I do remember:

I have bought myself a new graphics card. And I replaced the old graphics card with the new one I bought (it cost about 50 bucks) - and now I could play games like Euro Truck Simulator 2 much faster. This was the first time I touched hardware.

## Secondary education

In fifth and seventh grade, we had ITG ("Informationstechnische Grundbildung", roughly translates to "Basic information technology education") as a subject.
It was great!
This was the first time I realized that there are aspects where I know stuff my peers don't know yet.
I remember I was asked by the teachers to say what we should focus our lessons on (they had basically less clue than I did) and I was asked to present my findings and guide them through the exercises in front of the class.
Besides getting to know programs like Word, Excel or PowerPoint (where I always stressed that OpenOffice is much better because it is free), we had some lessons on HTML.
A part where I was able to shine.
It was really cool to teach them stuff because I felt valued as a person when they asked me. (Even though they didn't respect me when the classes were over.)

Initial hopes by my former teachers, my parents and by myself were that the bullying problem resolves itself when I finished primary school and got to secondary school.
Unfortunately, the bullying problem has not resolved itself, but got worse.
Essentially, my former peers - some of them were put into the class I went to - had managed to turn the class against another person and me.
I haven't really had friends.
My grades weren't good either, and I had to visit additional classes for both English and German that were intended to help the weakest.
I now think the bullying as well as a home where I didn't felt safe were two factors why my performance was quite weak.

I was sent to the school social worker and had regular meetings with her.
That was really helpful and a kind of rock in the surf.
A place where I have felt cared at - I think we talked a lot about computers and she was very concerned that I only play games that are not violent.
She was very patient as well.

To deal with these things that put a burden on me, I distracted myself by using the computer.

Sometime here, I've been given my second PC.
It was the old PC of my dad, who bought a new one.
It was a major upgrade and everything felt speedier.

Maybe because I saw more capabilities in the new PC, I started learning real programming languages (that is, a turing-complete programming language):

- Visual Basic - it was the foundation for the web browser I wrote back then (bascially, Internet Explorer with an even uglier yet functional interface)
- PHP - here is some [first proof](https://www.vb-paradise.de/index.php/Thread/108242-YouTube-Video-in-PHP-abspielen/?postID=935967#post935967) dating back to 2014.
- Batch - it was the scripting language for Windows before PowerShell became a thing. There was BjarneLP on YouTube, who posted an [extensive tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA5ck_LXPfPmsmRUJGh4a4XKrFrBhFsQQ) on it. It was great. Unfortunately, it was set private and cannot be accessed anymore. I never met Bjarne, but I'm really thankful for his work. It taught some basic concepts like input/output and variables etc.

Learning PHP included learning some basic SQL, because I used XAMPP to develop stuff (basically it provides a web server, PHP and a database).

Before he opted to turn against me, I taught a former peer some fundamentals of Visual Basic.

At the time of writing, I now realize that I apparently liked explaining things to others quite early.
I still like to get included and asked by peers because I feel valued then (maybe it's a bit of a unhealthy habit…).

I remember that I was so proud of myself that I knew what variables are when we were getting to know them in Math classes.

## Let's write the future

So, this is it. Thank you for your time to read this!
I noticed I used the word `I` quite often. :D

As I stated in the introduction, I mainly want to start blogging to not only share thoughts, but also do so in a structured way.
I'm really keen to get feedback on that.
You can feel free to do so using a Mastodon direct message or by shooting an e-mail at `mail@<the-hostname>.de` - or, if you happen to see me sometime, face-to-face.
